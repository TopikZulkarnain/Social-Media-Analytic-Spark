This notebook provided sentiment analysis for tweet data. The data consist 1.6 million entries but for this case Im using sampling so that only 50% data use for further analysis. Data only contains two features, text (tweet) and target (0 or 1) indicating wether the tweet include in negative or positive sentiment. I'm comparing two model which is Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes for classifyng the sentiment of tweets with two kind of feature extraction also which is CountVectorizer and TF-IDF. At the end, I'll decide which model fit the best for classifying sentiment of tweet by evalutaing model base on recall, precision, and F1 Score from Model.
